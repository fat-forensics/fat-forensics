class IncompatibleModelError(FATFException):

    Exception raised when a model lacks desired functionality.

    For example, it can be raised when a model is expected to output
    probabilities for its predictions but it does not support this
    functionality.

    """
    Exception raised when a model is unfitted and a fitted one is expected.

    This is usually raised when the model is not fitted and a ``predict`` or
    a ``predict_proba`` method is called.

    """
    Exception raised when a model is fitted and an unfitted one is expected.
